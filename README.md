# Insurance-Claims-Severity-Prediction

When youâ€™ve been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones. Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent. This is why it is important to improve the claims service for the over the millions of households in Inited States.

In this project, I'll try to build an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity by predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims.
